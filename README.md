# MissionWired-Data-Engineer

### This repo contains 2 Python files for the ETL exercise. Before running the code, please follow the steps below:
 - import pandas
 - The 3 datasets are in a folder called data in my drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sP16ZeSa8Gn8rid1UKgA3K6YO6et-lAY?usp=sharing (they are not here because the files are too large). Please put the data in the same directory with the 2 Python files before running the code.
 
 
Please also visit the below link to find the remaining answers for the Analytics exercise.
